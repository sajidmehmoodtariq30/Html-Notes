    <!-- There are six headings in HTML mainly from h1 to h6 -->
    <h1>First Heading</h1>
    <h2>Second Heading</h2>
    <h3>Third Heading</h3>
    <h4>Fourth Heading</h4>
    <h5>Fifth Heading</h5>
    <h6>Sixth Heading</h6>
    <!-- 
        h1 defines the most important heading and importance is decreased as the number goes down headings in html serve the same purpose as headings in a newspaper. Now we can also write simple text and increse its fs using css then whats the purpose of using heading Basically they are for search engines and bots that come and read our website.
        Headings should never be used to increse or decrease size but only to show importance size of a heading can be changed according to needs.

    <!-- Paragraph Tag -->
    <!-- A paragraph tag simply writes our code in a simple sequence like a simple paragraph in a Newspaper So whats the purpose of using it Again for SEO purposes and for chatbots but we can also target our elements if they are properly defined and understand what they do now if we write complete website in p tag or in h1 tag it will look almost same by applying css but will not be accurate for other coders or sometimes even yourself -->
